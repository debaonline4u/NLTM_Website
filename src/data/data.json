        "description": "This is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Language Identification system designed to identify 12 Indian languages. This model can identify Assamese, Bengali, English(Indian), Gujrati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Panjabi, Tamil and Telugu. Some details about these languages can be found here. Here, we use a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) based DNN model. In this system, the input speech is first converted into a sequence of bottelneck features (BNFs). The BLSTM layers in the DNN then analyse this sequence of BNFs by dividing it into fixed-length chunks (each chunk ~600 ms) to produce LID-seq-senones. Each LID-seq-senone is a compact representation of the given fixed-lingth chunk. These LID-seq-senones are then processed by a self-attention block, which assigns a weightage to each of these LID-seq-senones based on their relevance to the LID task. Using these attention values, weighted average of these LID-seq-senones are then computed to obtain an utterance-level representation of the speech (called u-vector). This u-vector is then processed by the output layer to identify the language. ",

Language plays a vital role in communication among people as well as in accessing information and building an inclusive society. India is home to 22 constitutionally recognized languages. However, there exist more than 1000 spoken languages in India. In this information era, it is important to ensure that a spoken language gets due representation in digital space. In this regard, enabling the cyber physical systems to understand and interact with people using the spoken Indian languages is very important. This avoids people to opt for a second language such as English to interact with the cyber physical systems. This will further contribute to the success of the prestigious digital India Programme of the Government of India as one of the limitations faced in this arena is the need for interacting with these systems in English. This requires building systems that can analyse the spoken Indian language.",

LID is very helpful in automatic speech recognition systems, speech translation systems, multi-lingual speech recognition, and in language diarization. Approaches for LID may be classified based on the features used and the methodology considered. Recently, deep neural networks (DNN) and convolution neural networks (CNN) based approaches are becoming popular for LID. In this project, we propose to explore deep learning-based approaches to build LID systems for Indian languages. The LID systems are usually vulnerable to noise and channel mismatch occurring due to the mismatch in the channels (like recording devices, type of encoding, etc.,) used to collect the speech samples. In this project we propose to build LID systems for Indian languages that are robust to noise and channel-mismatch."

The dialectal variations of a spoken Indian language are a matter of concern for any automatic processing of speech utterances from that language. The project aims at addressing the issues of identifying the dialect in the conversational speech of the Indian languages. Dialect identification is difficult when compared to LID due to high interclass similarity among the dialects of a language. Very little work is done on dialect identification in Indian languages except Hindi. We also propose to explore deep learning methods for the dialect identification task."
